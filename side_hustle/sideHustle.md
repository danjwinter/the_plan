# Side Hustle

## Side Hustle 1 - Ambulance Billing App

### MVP
A friend of mine had asked me to help him build an ambulance billing app. He runs operations for a larger ambulance company and has noted discrepancies in billing, mostly because employees don't realize that certain things are required. The MVP for this app would be to have an online form where when certain things are marked off, other parts become required.

### Future Iterations
- Mobile/Tablet Friendly
- HIPAA compliant
- Connect with CMS

### Why?
To help a friend in need.

### Staying on Track
I don't think this friend will let it go!

### Collaborators
I need to find someone familiar with HIPAA compliance from a developer perspective...

### Into the World
This would be pitched to my friend's company when there is an MVP and we'd go from there. This project would not be open source.
## Side Hustle 2 - Battle Ship

### MVP
This app would recreate the childhood classic battleship. The MVP would just contain a place where you can type in the coordinates of where each ship would be and its orientation. The background would be the periodic table of elements where you'd need to type in the actual element name to launch a missile but the board would only show you the abbreviations in order to aid in learning chemistry.

### Future Iterations
- Drag/Drop ships to their locations
- Let users customize background so teachers could use for learning things other than chemistry
- Web Sockets! Multi-player

### Why?
I saw a teacher friend post a DIY version of this and I thought it'd be neat to create it for the computer.

### Staying on Track
I'm planning on writing this all in JavaScript and recruit my brother to help me so that I can learn all his Google-y tricks. He and I talk a lot and he's pretty excited...plus I just want to learn from him.

### Collaborators
My brother.

### Into the World
Once completed, I'd make it available free online and try to get teacher friends to share with fellow teachers.

## Side Hustle 3 - Brewery Tracker

### MVP
With all the new breweries constantly popping up in Denver, this app would scrape popular websites like Beer Advocate and Rate Beer to look for any new breweries in the area. There would be tabs available for new in the last month, 3 months, 6 months and year along with an aggregated ranking from the previously mentioned sites.

### Future Iterations
- Location-based suggestions (closest to you currently)
- Beer journal to rank beers and breweries
- Brewery suggestions based on your rankings

### Why?
Because, well, beer.

### Staying on Track
Now that I'll be having some free time, trying new breweries is a goal so I don't think this will be an issue.

### Collaborators
TBD, I'm sure I can find some interested beer folk!

### Into the World
This would be available for free publicly upon completion. I'll even add it to product hunt to see if there's outside interest.
