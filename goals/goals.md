# Learning Goals

## Goal 1 - Learn VIM

### Current Spot
Mostly lost...I know you need to press i to insert and esc to leave insert mode.

### Success
Success would look like me being comfortable using VIM as my daily IDE.

### Resources
#### Written
- http://www.openvim.com/
- vimtutor
- http://www.labnol.org/internet/learning-vim-for-beginners/28820/

#### Mentors
My brother knows VIM and I'll also reach out to the French King for support.

#### Ideas
I hope to start using it for all of my free time development.

#### Talk Topics
- From Atom to VIM
- VI vs VIM
- What's all the fuss with VIM?

### Why?
While interviewing with Allstate, I had one of my pairs spend the entire time teaching me a little vim. It's become apparent how much those shortcuts can save you in the long run and I want to be more efficient when I code.

## Goal 2 - Learn React Better

### Current Spot
I've written one program with React and have a general idea but want to become more proficient.

### Success
I can dive into a React code base and understand what is going on.

### Resources
#### Written
- https://reactforbeginners.com/
- https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html

#### Mentors
I'm hoping to use react for my side hustle battle ship project and get my brother to act as a mentor and help build it with me.

#### Ideas
Side hustle - battle ship

#### Talk Topics
- Why/Why Not React
- React vs Ember vs That Sweet New Framework

### Why?
I really liked the reusable components in React and many of the companies I interviewed with were using React to some extent.

## Goal 3 - Algorithms

### Current Spot
I can write some basic sorting algorithms we did in mod 1 but I feel like I could have a much better approach to them.

### Success
Success for this one is a little weird - I know that down the road, many of the big tech companies have very algorithm heavy interview processes and I'd like to be able to nail algorithms in technical interviews.

### Resources
#### Written

- https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI

#### Mentors
Again, going for my brother since he's the most readily available and went for his computer science degree years back studying this stuff.

#### Ideas
I think completing those online classes are going to be the best, and maybe using different languages to make sure I really understand what's happening and avoid letting syntactic sugar do to much for me.

#### Talk Topics
- How to Attack Algorithms as a Junior Developer
- Self Balancing Trie

### Why?
I know that for my second and third developer jobs, algorithms and algorithmic thinking may play a much larger role and I want to be prepared.
